# Import Channels

This directory contains sample MIRTH channels that are responsible for importing data from Atticus. Each channel is designed to demonstrate how to import metadata as FHIR Patient, Encounter, Practitioner, and Task resources into Atticus. The channels can be used to integrate data from various sources, such as HL7v2 messages or parametrized URLs.
